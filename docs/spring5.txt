Jps(Java persistence api- official api for workign with relational dbs
-only a specification and not a concrete implementation
-Is a bridge from java object to how data is stored in dbs
orm- object relational mapping
-one api will support many relational dbs

Spring Data Repositories
 • Provides an Implementation of the Repository Pattern
 • Concept is originally from Eric Evans’ book Domain Driven Design 
 • A Repository has methods for retrieving domain objects should delegate to a specialized Repository object such that alternative storage implementations may be interchanged.
 • This is important. It allows you to easily substitute the persistence layer. • i.e. going from SQL to NoSQ
 
 Dependency injection-
 
 ApplicationContext- Does all the work loads all the dependencies and beans
 
 Dependency injection-
 Constructor based- which is preferred
 -property based-
 -getter setter based-
All must get annotations @controller and @autowired or it can results in nullpointers

Qaulifiers- if there are multiple implementations of the interface you would use qualifiers to tell spring which bean you want
@Qualifier("constructorGreetingService")- the string is the bean name

PrimaryBeans- multiple beans of the same type and you want to use one by default

Spring profiles-Configures spring at runtime on how it wires up things
-exmaple  profile with differnt data sources
use @Profile("es")
set up application.props
spring.profiles.active=en

default profile
if noting is specified in application.props then you can set it a default so nothing fails
@Profile({"en","default"})

Spring bean lifecycle

Spring Configuration options
Xml configuration- older projects, @ImportResource("classpath:chucknorrisconfig.xml")
-Java configuration- used in new projects
Annontations configuration-
component - @ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.avs.didemo.services"})  === scans all packages and below done in spring main class

Usefactory beans to make db connections
